            <h2>What is the issue?</h2>
            <p>Plastic is a synthetic organic polymer made from petroleum with properties ideally suited for a wide
                variety of applications including: packaging, building and construction, household and sports equipment,
                vehicles, electronics and agriculture.
                Over 300 million tons of plastic are produced every year, half of which is used to create single-use
                items such as shopping bags, cups and straws. If discarded improperly, plastic waste can harm the
                environment and biodiversity.</p>
            <p>At least 14 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year. Plastic debris is currently the most
                abundant type of litter in the ocean, making up 80% of all marine debris found from surface waters to
                deep-sea sediments. Plastic is found
                on the shorelines of every continent, with more plastic waste found near popular tourist destinations
                and densely populated areas.</p>
            <p>The main sources of plastic debris found in the ocean are land-based, coming from urban and stormwater
                runoff, sewer overflows, littering, inadequate waste disposal and management, industrial activities,
                tyre abrasion, construction and illegal
                dumping. Ocean-based plastic pollution originates primarily from the fishing industry, nautical
                activities and aquaculture.</p>
            <p>Under the influence of solar UV radiation, wind, currents and other natural factors, plastic breaks down
                into small particles called microplastics (particles smaller than 5 mm) or nanoplastics (particles
                smaller than 100 nm). The small size
                makes them easy for marine life to ingest accidentally.</p>
            <p>Many countries lack the infrastructure to prevent plastic pollution such as: sanitary landfills;
                incineration facilities; recycling capacity and circular economy infrastructure; proper management and
                disposal of waste systems. This leads to
                "plastic leakage" into rivers and the ocean. The legal and illegal global trade of plastic waste may
                also damage ecosystems, where waste management systems are not sufficient to contain plastic waste.</p>
