            <h2>What can be done?</h2>
            <p>Efforts should be made to adhere to and strengthen existing international legislative frameworks that
                address marine plastic pollution. The most important are the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine
                Pollution by Dumping Wastes and
                Other Matter (the London Convention), the 1996 Protocol to the London Convention (the London Protocol)
                and the 1978 Protocol to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships
                (MARPOL).</p>
            <p>Regional and national governments should also explore national legislative frameworks on Extended
                Producer Responsibility. These are emerging as innovative, low-cost solutions, as are policies to
                promote circular economies.</p>
            <p>Governments, research institutions and industries need to work collaboratively to redesign products, and
                rethink their use and disposal to reduce microplastic waste from pellets, synthetic textiles and tyres.
                Consumers and society must shift
                to more sustainable consumption patterns. This will require solutions which go beyond waste management
                and consider the whole lifecycle of plastic products; from design to infrastructure, and household use.
            </p>
            <p>More funding for research and innovation should be made available to provide policymakers, manufacturers
                and consumers with the evidence needed to implement technological, behavioural and policy solutions to
                address marine plastic pollution.</p>
            <p>Methodologies to identify, measure and address marine plastic pollution sources and plastic leakage are
                available.</p>
