            <p>Your name is Koe the purple fish and you are swimming in the ocean, trying to eat food in order to
                survive.</p>
            <p>You can move Koe by moving your mouse or trackpad. Your goal is to try and eat as many worms as you can
                without eating too much plastic that is present in the foodchain. Watch out for other fish that are
                swimming in the waters, because they
                will eat you if you get too close.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately this is not a game you can win. Much like our hero Koe, there is no way to tell how much
                plastic exists in the food you eat...</p>
